I'm a PhD candidate in Environmental Engineering (Air Quality specialty) at UC Berkeley. Currently in the final stages of my doctoral journey, I am actively seeking exciting opportunities and challenging roles that align with my expertise starting from June 2024. 

My research and career goals are driven by a larger vision of sustainable solutions for mitigating air pollution's impact on climate and public health. My current research is focused on building and evaluating anthropogenic emissions inventories in the vehicle sector. I have previously worked on research involving wildfire smoke prediction, atmosphere-biosphere dynamics, and inverse modeling of oil and gas emissions. My broader interests are in:

> Climate science: I am deeply invested in climate mitigation/adaptation, and I would like to contribute to sustainable pathways towards resiliency by leveraging my technical skills in atmospheric modeling and my experience working in interdisciplinary topics. 

> Carbon emissions: Understanding carbon markets and their role in addressing climate challenges is a key point of interest. My goal is to bridge the gap between scientific research and effective policy implementation, driving positive environmental change through innovative approaches. 

> Air Quality: My primary research focus has been on understanding anthropogenic emissions to better inform pathways to reduction and how air quality management strategies can improve the life of those living in urban areas. 


As I embark on the next chapter of my career, I am eager to bring my expertise to a challenging and impactful role. If you are someone who is looking for a motivated and skilled professional to your team, I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and interests align with your vision.

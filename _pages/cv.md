Education
======
* Ph.D in Environmental Engineering (Air Quality), UC Berkeley 2024 (expected)
  * National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship
  * High-Resolution Mapping and Modeling of Vehicle Emissions to Understand Urban Air Quality Challenges
* M.S. in Environmental Engineering, UC Berkeley, 2020
* B.A. in Atmospheric Science, B.A. in Environmental Sciences, UC Berkeley, 2019

Work experience
======
* University of California, Berkeley - Graduate Student Researcher, 08/2019-present
  * Advisor: Dr. Robert Harley
  * Forecasted future vehicle emission scenarios using Python and ArcGIS based on technological advancement, electrification, and fleet change projections to determine changes to air pollution and human health patterns 
  * Determined long term (1990-2019) trends of emissions from on-road sources at state and national scales and published results in Journal of Environmental Science and Technology  
  * Used Python to evaluate viability of high-resolution forecasting model HRRR-Smoke as a public-use smoke predictor and co-authored paper in Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society
  * Presented findings to research scientists at NOAA and to Berkeley faculty and colleagues, conveying policy-relevant identification of areas for improvement in air pollution mitigation efforts

* National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) - Intern (Regional Chemical Modeling Group), 08/2021-08/2022
  * Led collaborative project involving NOAA and Berkeley researchers to create a high-resolution vehicle emission inventory for California and used this inventory as input in a coupled weather-chemistry model (WRF-Chem) on a high-performance computing (HPC) system
  * Applied Python and ArcGIS to analyze multiple runs involving 1 to 3 TB of outputs each and processed satellite, aircraft, and ground observational data for comparison
  * Identified potential discrepancies in regulatory inventories and published results in Journal of Environmental Science and Technology


* University of California, Berkeley - Student Research Assistant, 05/2017–05/2019
  * Developed creative problem-solving solutions during installation of Campbell Scientific sensors (temperature, humidity, and soil moisture) and Dynamax sensors (sap flow) at a remote, forested field site 
  * Analyzed water use efficiency of different tree species using satellite data and created data visualizations in Python; expanded this research into an honors thesis
